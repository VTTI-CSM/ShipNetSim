# Ship Network Simulator (ShipNetSim)
ShipNetSim is an open-source simulation software designed to analyze ship energy consumption and emissions in extensive maritime networks. Built with a modular and adaptable structure using Qt6, it integrates propulsion-resistance models, real-time environmental data, and advanced path-finding algorithms for longitudinal vessel motion analysis.

## Features

- **Open Access**: ShipNetSim is freely accessible and openly modifiable to support community collaboration.
- **Modular and Flexible**: Ships of varying types, sizes, and fuel types can be analyzed, with scalability to support evolving policies and technological advancements.
- **Environmental Sensitivity**: Capable of simulating operational strategies like reduced speeds and alternate fueling to comply with International Maritime Organization (IMO) standards.
- **Cybersecurity Modeling**: Analyzes risks like GPS spoofing and network disruptions, simulating impact on ship navigation and energy efficiency.
- **Real-time Analytics**: Tracks energy consumption, emissions, and vessel dynamics for each ship, enabling data-driven decisions.
- **Adaptable Pathfinding**: Integrates visibility graphs and QuadTree indexing to optimize navigation and obstacle avoidance on real-world routes.

## Getting Started
Download the latest release version on the releases page.

## Prerequisites
ShipNetSim requires no additional setup, as all third-party dependencies are bundled within the installer.

## Installation

- Download the installer file.
- Double-click to open and follow the setup prompts. The default path is C:\Program Files\ShipNetSim, but this can be adjusted as needed.

## Running

### GUI Interface
- The GUI is still under developement. 

### Shell Interface
- Open a terminal or command prompt.

- Navigate to the installation folder:

```shell
cd "C:\Program Files\ShipNetSim"
Type ShipNetSim -h to view command options.
```

```shell
ShipNetSim.exe -s "path\to\ships\file"
```
